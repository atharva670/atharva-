    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
  
    <p>I'm a web developer with expertise in building modern web applications.
      A web developer is responsible for designing, creating, and maintaining websites and web applications. The role involves working with various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend frameworks like Node.js, Django, or Laravel. Web developers can specialize in front-end development, focusing on user interfaces and experiences, or back-end development, handling server-side logic and databases. Full-stack developers manage both aspects. They also ensure websites are responsive, secure, and optimized for performance. Continuous learning is crucial in this field due to rapid technological advancements. Strong problem-solving skills and creativity are essential for developing efficient and visually appealing web solutions.
